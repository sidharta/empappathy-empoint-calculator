## How to Build

Requires [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) 2.10 or greater, and JDK 7+ in order to run.

To build, run

    gradle clean build

Building will run the tests, but to explicitly run tests you can use the test target

    gradle test

## Run from Command Line

To start the app from command line, just run the command:

	gradle appengineRun
